**Motor Features**
 I have chosen a motor which model is C42-L90 dc bruch motor(wiring code 10) from moog components. 
 Nominal terminal voltage:48V
 Rated terminal voltage:24-60V
 Rated output power:317W
 Rated torque: 2.37Nm
 Rated current: 8.5A
 Friction torque:0.17Nm
 No-load speed:1273rpm
 Rated speed(at full load):811rpm
 Rotor inertia:21890.7 g*cm^2
 Coil inductance:2 mH
 Electrical time constant: 3.33
 Mechanical time constant: 10.526
 Weight: 7.428kg
 
 
 

**Source and control system**
  -> Controlled voltege source
    in order to feed the motor I used controlled voltage source which takes a reference signal from output of the pid controller
    according to desired speed.
  -> Sensors(simulink motion sensor, ampermeter, voltmeter) 
  -> pid cortoller 
      pid can arranged with tuned application
